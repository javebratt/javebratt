## Hi, I'm Jorge üëãüèΩ

I'm a Full Stack JavaScript developer with a passion for building high-performance mobile apps using web technologies like Ionic Framework, Angular, React, and Firebase.

My expertise lies in creating apps that seamlessly run on the web and mobile, making complex functionalities feel simple for users.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on software solutions for both small teams and Fortune 500 companies, especially in the logistics space. From streamlining operations to managing large-scale projects, I've been involved in some exciting and challenging projects.

Aside from coding, I love sharing what I've learned. I write articles and create video tutorials on **Ionic, Firebase, Angular, and React**, helping other developers build better apps and understand the tech stack more deeply.

Need help? Feel free to reach out! üì¨

The easiest way to get in touch (_unless you want me to debug something_) is [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgevergara-developer/) or [on Bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/jorgevergara.co).

I'd love to hear from you!

**P.S**: [You can donate to support my tutorials](https://javebratt.kit.com/products/tip).

It helps me create more articles and videos. It's a small gesture that goes a long way in helping me create more content for the community.

Thank you!
