# What do you write in an about page?

Seriously, what do you write in an about page? I’ll do my best to keep this page
short and give you a few insights on who I am.

I’m Jorge and I am a Full Stack Developer specialized in building mobile apps.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing Nintendo with my son, going sightseeing with
my wife and I’m determined to try all of the burgers in Colombia.
