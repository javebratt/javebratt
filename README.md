# What do you write in an about page?

Seriously, what do you write in an about page? I’ll do my best to keep this page
short and give you a few insights on who I am.

I’m Jorge and I am a software developer specialized in building mobile apps.

For the past 6 years, I’ve been focused on building apps with web technologies
(_such as Angular and Ionic Framework_) and Firebase.

I’m an Ionic Framework Community Leader and a Google Developer Expert for
Firebase.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing Mario Kart with my son, going sightseeing with
my wife and I’m determined to try all of the burgers in Colombia.

Want to get in touch? The easiest way to reach out is through Twitter, you can
find me there as [@javebratt](https://twitter.com/javebratt).
