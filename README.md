# What do you write in an about page?

Iâ€™m Jorge, and Iâ€™m a Full Stack JavaScript developer.

I specialize in building mobile apps running on the browser with web technologies such as [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and [nodejs](https://nestjs.com/).

I've worked with and lead teams that build software for handling logistics operations of fortune 500 companies.

My goal is to help more companies manage their projects, make sure their architecture lets them scale, share code between multiple applications, and re-use as much of it as they can.
